    <!-- This is the large image on the website. I worked with Andrei from class to fix this part. Originally, I just had it as a figure and kept the file linked from CSS because I wasn't able to crop the image as previously shown. Andrei figured out that as long as we changed the background-size to object-fit then it would maintain our previous crop. -->

                <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
                <p>
                    The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they
                    travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase
                    your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

                <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
                <p>
                    The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an
                    internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management
                    gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

                <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
                <p>
                    Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps
                    you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets
                    and increase your lead generation.

                <p>
                    Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers
