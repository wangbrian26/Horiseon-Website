# BWang Horiseon Website

## Week 1 Module 1 Challenge - UCI Bootcamp

This was our first challenge project of our bootcamp. Overall, we were given a basic website that included HTML and CSS files already written out. We were then asked to edit the semantic HTML and make sure that our CSS matched the new semantics of the HTML code. I got rid of most if not all of the divs in the HTML and made sure to follow the semantic guidelines.
